                            <h3>About</h3>
                            <p>George Potts recently submitted his PhD in English Literature at University College London, which explores the relationship between the writings of John Milton and Geoffrey Hill. He also completed his BA in English Language and Literature (first-class honours) and MA in English: Issues in Modern Culture (distinction) at UCL.
                            </p>

                            <p>He is a Postgraduate Teaching Assistant in the English Department at UCL for the 2016-17 academic year, where he was previously a Fourth-Year Teaching Fellow for the final year of his PhD.
                            </p>

                            <p>His primary research interest is in twentieth-century and contemporary poetry. As well as this, he has a strong secondary interest in film and television, for which he organized the seminar series '"Complex TV": television drama in the twenty-first century', which featured in the Guardian and the Economist's Intelligent Life blog.
